# Airbnb-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

Complete the process to overview the dashboard 

 I have created an amazing interactive and dynamic dashboard with Tableau using the Airbnb dataset for New York City.

## Introduction

This project showcases an interactive and dynamic dashboard built using Tableau to explore Airbnb listings in New York City. The dashboard allows you to gain insights into various aspects of the Airbnb market, including:

* Listing Prices and Availability: Explore average listing prices across different boroughs and neighbourhoods. Identify areas with higher or lower pricing trends.
* Room Type Distribution: Analyze the distribution of different room types (entire place, private room, shared room) offered by Airbnb hosts.
* Location Analysis: View listings plotted on a map of New York City, with colour-coding or symbols representing key metrics like price range.
* Host Information: Gain insights into the number of listings offered by different hosts.

## Features

* Interactive Filters: Narrow down your analysis by selecting specific boroughs, neighbourhoods, price ranges, or room types.
* Drill-Down Capabilities: Explore visualizations in more detail by clicking on specific elements (e.g., clicking on a borough on the map might filter other charts to that borough).
* Tooltips: Hover over chart elements for additional information about listings.
* Dynamic Charts and Maps: The visualizations update in real time as you interact with filters, providing a seamless exploration experience.

## Data Source

The dashboard utilizes the publicly available Airbnb NYC Open Data, which can be found on Kaggle or other data repositories.

## Using the Dashboard

Software:

This dashboard requires Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public to be opened and interacted with. You can download Tableau Public for free if you don't have Tableau Desktop.

Opening the Dashboard:

1. Download the `.twb` file containing the Tableau workbook.
2. Open the downloaded file in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.

**Exploring the Dashboard:**

* The dashboard layout is divided into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data (e.g., map, price distribution chart, host information chart).
* Use the filters provided on the left or top of the dashboard to narrow down your analysis.
* Click on elements within the visualizations to activate drill-down functionalities.
* Hover over chart elements to view tooltips with additional details.
